Based on the reports, here's an analysis ranking the indicators by their usefulness, focusing on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and returns correlation:

Top Performers:

1. RSI
- SNR: 5.2670 (Highest)
- Returns correlation: 0.2486
- Good balance of signal quality and predictive power
- Relatively stable with low kurtosis (0.1694)

2. MFI (Money Flow Index)
- SNR: 3.4879
- Returns correlation: 0.1112
- Good signal quality but lower predictive power
- Similar characteristics to RSI but incorporates volume

3. RVI (Relative Volatility Index)
- SNR: 2.6600
- Returns correlation: 0.2756
- Good balance of signal quality and returns correlation
- Quick mean reversion (negative autocorrelation at lag 10)

4. KELTNER
- SNR: 2.2903
- Returns correlation: 0.5092 (Highest)
- Best returns correlation among all indicators
- Low autocorrelation at longer lags indicating responsiveness

5. NATR (Normalized ATR)
- SNR: 1.8322
- Returns correlation: -0.0122
- Good signal quality but poor returns prediction
- High persistence (strong autocorrelation)

Middle Performers:

6. PSAR
- SNR: 1.7023
- Returns correlation: -0.0152
- Very high price correlation (0.9986) but poor returns prediction
- Extremely persistent (high autocorrelation)

7. BBANDS
- SNR: 1.5169
- Returns correlation: 0.3656
- Good returns correlation
- Strong mean-reverting properties (Hurst: 0.0563)

8. ATR
- SNR: 1.2750
- Returns correlation: -0.0025
- Strong price correlation (0.7773)
- Better for volatility measurement than direction prediction

Poor Performers:
- Most other indicators (ROC, DPO, PPO, CCI, etc.) show low SNR (<1.0) and inconsistent returns correlations

Recommendations:

1. Primary Signals:
- Use Keltner Channels for main trading signals (best returns correlation)
- Confirm with RSI (best signal-to-noise ratio)

2. Secondary Confirmation:
- BBANDS for mean reversion trades
- RVI for volatility regime changes
- MFI for volume-price confirmation

3. Risk Management:
- Use NATR/ATR for position sizing
- Monitor PSAR for trend changes

4. Avoid:
- ROC, PPO, and TRIX show poor predictive power and low SNR
- CMF and DPO have very low signal quality

Best Parameter Settings:
- Most indicators perform best with longer timeperiods (25)
- Keltner Channels: shorter timeperiod (10) with longer ATR period (25)
- RSI/MFI: 25-period settings for stability
- RVI: shorter timeperiod (10) for responsiveness

This analysis suggests a trading system should focus on the top 4-5 indicators while using others primarily for confirmation or risk management rather than primary signals.
